                <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2 cups mushrooms such as button, cremini, or wild mushrooms</li>
                <li>8 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth</li>
                <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 ¾ cups arborio risotto rice</li>
                <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>1/3 cup mascarpone cheese or cream cheese</li>
                <li>1/3 cup fresh grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving</li>
                <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Homemade mushroom powder, <b>optional</b></li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>12 sage leaves for garnish</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Clean mushrooms by wiping them with a dry paper towel. Remove mushroom stems, roughly chop them, and set aside. Cut mushroom caps into 1/4-inch thick slices. (If large, cut into bite-sized pieces.)</li>

                <li>Make the mushroom broth. Pour broth into a 3-quart saucepan. Add chopped mushroom stems, thyme, bay leaf, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook at a low simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Strain stock and discard the stems, thyme, and bay leaf. You should have about 6 cups of broth; if not, add water or more broth.</li>

                <li>In a 3-quart deep heavy saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add mushroom slices and onion, then cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the wine, then cook until reduced by half.</li>

                <li>Add 1/2 cup of the mushroom-infused stock and cook over medium-high heat, constantly stirring, until the rice has absorbed the liquid. Repeat this until 5 to 5 ½ cups of broth have been added and the rice is cooked but slightly chewy.</li>

                <li>Stir in the mascarpone cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of mushroom powder (optional).</li>

                <li>Make fried sage leaves. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in an 8-inch skillet. Add sage leaves, a few at a time, in a single layer. Fry for 15 seconds, but do not brown. Transfer the leaves from the skillet to paper towels and sprinkle with a pinch of salt.</li>

                <li>Serve risotto in individual shallow bowls. Top each with a few sage leaves and parmesan cheese shavings.</li>
